    print("1. Tissues and Organs")
    print("2. Acids and Alkalis")
    print("3. Movement and Pressure")
    print("4. Respiration")
    print("5. Photosynthesis")
    print("Through this interactive program, you'll learn key concepts, "
          "formulas, and examples related to these topics.")
    print("At the end of each section, there will be quiz questions to test your understanding.")
    print("Let's begin!\n")

# --- Tissues and Organs ---
def tissues_and_organs():
    print("\n--- Tissues and Organs ---")
    print("Tissues are groups of similar cells that work together to perform a specific function.")
    print("For example, muscle tissue is made of cells that contract to produce movement, "
          "while nervous tissue transmits signals throughout the body.")
    print("Organs are made up of different types of tissues working together to perform specific roles.")
    print("For instance, the heart contains muscle tissue for pumping blood and nervous tissue to control the heartbeat.")
    print("Organs do not work alone. They are part of organ systems, like the digestive system or circulatory system.")
    print("\nQuick fact: The human body has about 78 organs, including vital ones like the heart, brain, and lungs.")
    print("\nQuiz Time!")
    question1 = input("Q1: Which organ pumps blood around the body? ").lower()
    if question1 == "heart":
        print("Correct!")
    else:
        print("Incorrect. The correct answer is 'heart'.")
    question2 = input("Q2: What type of tissue transmits electrical signals? ").lower()
    if question2 == "nervous tissue" or question2 == "nervous":
        print("Correct!")
    else:
        print("Incorrect. The correct answer is 'nervous tissue'.")

# --- Acids and Alkalis ---
def acids_and_alkalis():
    print("\n--- Acids and Alkalis ---")
    print("The pH scale is a measure of how acidic or alkaline a substance is. It ranges from 0 to 14.")
    print("Substances with a pH less than 7 are acidic. Acids taste sour and can be corrosive.")
    print("Examples include lemon juice, vinegar, and stomach acid (hydrochloric acid).")
    print("Substances with a pH greater than 7 are alkaline. Alkalis feel slippery and are often used in cleaning products.")
    print("Examples include soap, baking soda, and limewater.")
    print("Neutral substances, such as pure water, have a pH of exactly 7.")
    print("\nQuick fact: Indicators like litmus paper and universal indicator show whether a substance is an acid or alkali.")
    print("\nQuiz Time!")
    question3 = input("Q3: What is the pH of a neutral substance? ")
    if question3 == "7":
        print("Correct!")

        print("Correct!")
    else:
        print("Incorrect. The correct answer is 'alkali'.")

# --- Movement and Pressure ---
def movement_and_pressure():
    print("\n--- Movement and Pressure ---")
    print("Pressure is the force applied per unit area, measured in newtons per square meter (N/m²) or pascals (Pa).")
    print("The formula for pressure is: Pressure = Force / Area.")
    print("For example, if a force of 50 N is applied over an area of 5 m², the pressure is 10 N/m².")
    print("Movement occurs when forces acting on an object are unbalanced. These forces can include gravity, friction, and air resistance.")
    print("Smaller areas increase pressure for the same force, which is why sharp objects like knives cut better.")
    print("\nQuick fact: Atmospheric pressure is caused by the weight of air above us and decreases as altitude increases.")
    print("\nQuiz Time!")
    question5 = input("Q5: If a force of 10 N is applied over an area of 2 m², what is the pressure? ")
    if question5 == "5" or question5 == "5 n/m²":
        print("Correct!")
    else:
        print("Incorrect. The correct answer is '5 N/m²'.")
    question6 = input("Q6: True or False - Larger area reduces pressure for the same force. ").lower()
    if question6 == "true":
        print("Correct!")
    else:
        print("Incorrect. The correct answer is 'True'.")

# --- Respiration ---
def respiration():
    print("\n--- Respiration ---")
    print("Respiration is the process by which living organisms release energy from glucose.")
    print("This energy is essential for movement, growth, and repair.")
    print("Aerobic respiration requires oxygen and occurs in most plants and animals. Its formula is:")
    print("Glucose + Oxygen -> Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy.")
    print("Anaerobic respiration does not require oxygen and produces less energy. In humans, it produces lactic acid:")
    print("Glucose -> Lactic acid + Energy.")
    print("\nQuick fact: In yeast, anaerobic respiration produces ethanol and is used in brewing and baking.")
    print("\nQuiz Time!")
    question7 = input("Q7: What gas is essential for aerobic respiration? ").lower()
    if question7 == "oxygen":
        print("Correct!")
    else:
        print("Incorrect. The correct answer is 'oxygen'.")

    if question8 == "lactic acid":
        print("Correct!")
    else:
        print("Incorrect. The correct answer is 'lactic acid'.")

# --- Photosynthesis ---
def photosynthesis():
    print("\n--- Photosynthesis ---")
    print("Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants use sunlight to make their own food.")
    print("The process occurs in the chloroplasts, which contain the green pigment chlorophyll.")
    print("The formula for photosynthesis is:")
    print("Carbon dioxide + Water + Light energy -> Glucose + Oxygen.")
    print("This process is vital because it provides energy for plants and oxygen for other living organisms.")
    print("\nQuick fact: Photosynthesis mainly happens in the leaves of plants.")
    print("\nQuiz Time!")
    question9 = input("Q9: What pigment absorbs sunlight in plants? ").lower()
