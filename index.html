            <h2>Tissues & Organs</h2>
            <p>
                Tissues are groups of specialized cells that have similar structures and perform a common function. For example, muscle tissue contracts to create movement, while epithelial tissue covers and protects surfaces in the body. Each type of tissue is crucial for the proper functioning of the body. Tissues are organized into organs, such as the heart, lungs, and stomach.
            </p>
            <p>
                Organs are made up of multiple tissues that work together to perform specific tasks. For instance, the heart is responsible for pumping blood throughout the body. It contains muscle tissue for contraction, connective tissue for structure, and nerve tissue for transmitting signals. Together, these tissues ensure that the heart functions effectively to circulate blood and deliver oxygen to all parts of the body.
            </p>
            <p>
                The interaction of tissues and organs forms organ systems, such as the circulatory system, respiratory system, and digestive system. These systems work together to maintain the body’s homeostasis and allow us to perform everyday activities like breathing, eating, and moving.

            <h2>Acids & Alkalis</h2>
            <p>
                Acids and alkalis are key components in chemistry and play an important role in many chemical reactions. Acids are substances that release hydrogen ions (H⁺) in a solution, making them acidic. They are often sour-tasting and can be corrosive. Common examples of acids include hydrochloric acid (HCl), found in stomach acid, and citric acid, found in lemons and oranges.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alkalis, on the other hand, are substances that release hydroxide ions (OH⁻) in a solution. They are the chemical opposites of acids and have a slippery feel. Alkalis are often used in cleaning products because they can neutralize acids and break down fats. Common alkalis include sodium hydroxide, which is found in drain cleaners, and ammonia, used in household cleaners.
            </p>
            <p>
                The pH scale, ranging from 0 to 14, measures how acidic or alkaline a substance is. Substances with a pH below 7 are acidic, those above 7 are alkaline, and a pH of 7 is neutral. Universal indicators and litmus paper are commonly used to determine the pH of a solution. Understanding acids and alkalis is crucial in industries like medicine, agriculture, and food production.

        <section id="movement-and-pressure">
            <h2>Movement & Pressure</h2>
            <p>
                Movement in living organisms is made possible by the interaction of bones, muscles, and joints. The human skeleton provides structure and protection while allowing flexibility through joints. For example, the hinge joint in the elbow allows movement in one direction, whereas the ball-and-socket joint in the shoulder allows rotation. Muscles work in pairs; when one muscle contracts, the other relaxes to create movement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pressure is another important concept in science. It is defined as the force exerted on a surface divided by the area over which the force is applied. In everyday life, pressure explains why sharp knives cut better than blunt ones—smaller surface areas create higher pressure. In physics, pressure is measured in Pascals (Pa), where one Pascal equals one Newton per square meter.
            </p>
            <p>
                Understanding pressure is important in various contexts, from the design of buildings and vehicles to how fluids move in pipelines. For instance, in the human body, blood pressure is crucial for the circulation of oxygen and nutrients. Engineers and scientists use the principles of pressure to optimize tools, machines, and even weather forecasts.

        <section id="respiration-and-photosynthesis">
            <h2>Respiration & Photosynthesis</h2>
            <p>
                Respiration is the biological process by which organisms break down glucose to release energy. This energy is used for essential activities like growth, repair, and movement. Aerobic respiration, which occurs in the presence of oxygen, is the most efficient type and produces carbon dioxide and water as byproducts. Anaerobic respiration, which occurs without oxygen, produces less energy and can result in the buildup of lactic acid in muscles.
            </p>
            <p>
                Photosynthesis, on the other hand, is the process by which plants produce their own food. Using sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water, plants produce glucose and oxygen. This process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, which contain a green pigment called chlorophyll. The glucose produced serves as energy for the plant, and the oxygen is released into the atmosphere.
            </p>
            <p>
                Together, respiration and photosynthesis form a cycle that maintains the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the environment. While animals rely on plants for oxygen and food, plants rely on animals for carbon dioxide. This interdependence is a key component of ecosystems and highlights the importance of conserving natural habitats.
