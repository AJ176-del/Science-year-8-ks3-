            <h2>Tissues & Organs</h2>
            <p>
                Tissues are groups of specialized cells that have similar structures and perform a common function. For example, muscle tissue contracts to create movement, while epithelial tissue covers and protects surfaces in the body. Each type of tissue is crucial for the proper functioning of the body.
            </p>
            <p>
                Organs are made up of multiple tissues that work together to perform specific tasks. For instance, the heart is responsible for pumping blood throughout the body.

            <h2>Acids & Alkalis</h2>
            <p>
                Acids are substances that release hydrogen ions (H⁺) in a solution, while alkalis release hydroxide ions (OH⁻). The pH scale, ranging from 0 to 14, measures how acidic or alkaline a substance is. Substances below pH 7 are acidic, those above 7 are alkaline, and pH 7 is neutral.
            </p>
            <p>
                Understanding acids and alkalis helps in industries like medicine, agriculture, and food production.

            <h2>Movement & Pressure</h2>
            <p>
                Movement in living organisms involves the skeleton and muscles. The human skeleton provides structure, while joints and muscles allow flexibility and mobility.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pressure is the force applied per unit area. It explains why sharp objects are more effective at cutting compared to blunt ones.

        <section id="respiration-and-photosynthesis" class="card">
            <h2>Respiration & Photosynthesis</h2>
            <p>
                Respiration is the process of breaking down glucose to release energy, essential for life processes. Photosynthesis is the process plants use to produce glucose and oxygen using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide.
            </p>
            <p>
                Together, these processes form a cycle that maintains the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the environment.
