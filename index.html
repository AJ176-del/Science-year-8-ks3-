    <section id="tissues-organs">
      <h2>Tissues and Organs</h2>
      <p>Tissues are groups of cells that work together to perform a specific function. Examples include muscle tissue for movement and nerve tissue for signaling.</p>
      <p>Organs are made of multiple tissues that collaborate to form a structure with a particular function, such as the heart or lungs.</p>
      <p>The human body relies on systems of tissues and organs to perform life-sustaining functions like digestion, circulation, and respiration.</p>

    <section id="acids-alkalis">
      <h2>Acids and Alkalis</h2>
      <p>Acids have a pH less than 7, while alkalis have a pH greater than 7. Neutral substances, like water, have a pH of 7.</p>
      <p>Examples of acids include vinegar and lemon juice, while soaps and baking soda are common alkalis.</p>
      <p>The pH scale is essential in science for measuring the strength of acids and alkalis, which have many uses in everyday life and industry.</p>

    <section id="movement-pressure">
      <h2>Movement and Pressure</h2>
      <p>Movement depends on the skeletal and muscular systems. Muscles pull on bones to enable movement, with joints providing flexibility.</p>
      <p>Pressure is the force applied over a surface area, important for blood circulation, breathing, and engineering designs like syringes.</p>
      <p>Understanding movement and pressure helps us analyze how forces act on objects and the human body in daily activities.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="respiration-photosynthesis">
      <h2>Respiration and Photosynthesis</h2>
      <p>Respiration is the process by which organisms break down glucose to release energy, occurring in the mitochondria of cells.</p>
      <p>Photosynthesis is how plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen, essential for life on Earth.</p>
      <p>Both processes are interconnected, with photosynthesis providing oxygen for respiration and respiration releasing carbon dioxide for photosynthesis.</p>
