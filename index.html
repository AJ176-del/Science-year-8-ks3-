        <h2>Tissues and Organs</h2>
        <p>
            Tissues are groups of similar cells working together to perform a particular function. For example, muscle tissue contracts to allow movement, while nerve tissue transmits signals throughout the body.
        </p>
        <p>
            Organs are made up of different types of tissues that work together to carry out a specific job. For example, the heart is an organ made up of muscle tissue, connective tissue, and other types, all working together to pump blood.
        </p>

        <h2>Acids and Alkalis</h2>
        <p>
            Acids are substances that have a pH less than 7, while alkalis are substances with a pH greater than 7. Common acids include citric acid found in lemon juice, and common alkalis include sodium hydroxide.
        </p>
        <p>
            Neutral substances have a pH of 7, such as pure water. In science, we often use indicators, like litmus paper, to test whether a substance is acidic, alkaline, or neutral.
        </p>

        <h2>Movement and Pressure</h2>
        <p>
            Movement in animals is controlled by the nervous system and muscles. Animals use muscles to move bones, allowing for various forms of movement such as walking, running, or swimming.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pressure is the force exerted on an area. For example, when you inflate a balloon, the air inside creates pressure, making the balloon expand.
        </p>

        <h2>Respiration and Photosynthesis</h2>
        <p>
            Respiration is the process by which organisms release energy from food. In humans, this occurs inside the cells where oxygen is used to convert glucose into energy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This is how plants make their own food and produce the oxygen we breathe.
