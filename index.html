      <h2>Tissues and Organs</h2>
      <p>
        Tissues are groups of cells that work together to perform a specific function. Examples include muscle tissue for movement and nerve tissue for signaling. Organs are made of multiple tissues that collaborate to form a structure with a particular function, such as the heart or lungs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The human body relies on these systems to perform life-sustaining functions. For instance, the digestive system includes organs like the stomach and intestines to process food into energy. Understanding tissues and organs helps us appreciate how our bodies work!

    <section id="acids-alkalis" class="animated-section">
      <h2>Acids and Alkalis</h2>
      <p>
        Acids are substances with a pH less than 7, while alkalis are substances with a pH greater than 7. Neutral substances have a pH of 7. Examples of acids include vinegar and lemon juice, while soaps and baking soda are common alkalis.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pH scale helps us measure the strength of acids and alkalis. Acids can be dangerous at high concentrations, but they also have many uses, such as in cleaning and food preservation. Alkalis are used in household cleaners and manufacturing.

    <section id="movement-pressure" class="animated-section">
      <h2>Movement and Pressure</h2>
      <p>
        Movement in the body depends on the skeletal and muscular systems. Muscles contract to pull on bones, enabling movement. Joints like hinges allow flexibility, while ligaments hold bones together for stability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pressure is the force applied over a surface area. It affects various processes, such as blood circulation in the body and atmospheric pressure affecting our breathing. Engineers use pressure concepts to design tools like syringes and hydraulics.

    <section id="respiration-photosynthesis" class="animated-section">
      <h2>Respiration and Photosynthesis</h2>
      <p>
        Respiration is the process by which organisms break down glucose to release energy. This occurs in the mitochondria of cells and is essential for life. Aerobic respiration requires oxygen, while anaerobic respiration occurs without it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Photosynthesis is how plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. This process happens in chloroplasts using chlorophyll. It is the foundation of life on Earth, providing energy and oxygen for other organisms.
